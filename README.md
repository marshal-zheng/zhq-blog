â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.

> **_Warning!_** If you're using `yarn 1`, you might need to [install `sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install) as a dependency.

Then start the project by running the following commands:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm run install

# start running the project
npm run dev
```

As an alternative approach, if you have Docker installed, you can use Docker to run this project locally. Here's how:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t zhq-blog .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 4321:80 zhq-blog
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

> **_Note!_** For `Docker` commands we must have it [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) in your machine.
